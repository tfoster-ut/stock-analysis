# Stock Analysis
An analysis of stock data utilizing VBA

## Overview of Project
During this analysis we sought to create an easy to run analysis of all stocks in 2017 and 2018.  There was a particular emphasis on knowing the performance of the DQ stock, but this was later rolled up into a analysis of all stocks.

### Purpose 
The goal of this analysis to analyze the performance of a particular stock.  We did this by looking specifically at the annualized return based on the starting price and the closing price of the stock.  This will provide a year over year comparison that allows to adjust the performance of a particular stock through the current years and future years to come.
